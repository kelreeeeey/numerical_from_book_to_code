# Me Brain Deeds

## 26/12/2024

Add more subdirectories for the sake of better separation

additons:

- bins/
    will be holdin any final program sourced directly from `source/*.c`

- material/
    will be containing any source material, planned to be in markdown formats but pdfs or even pptx would ok too

- python_libs/
    will be containing by the mid representation of shared-object loaded in python class so the `./main.py` could read it.

- shared_objects/
    the compiled shared object for python from `source/*.c`

- so happy i can compile 2 different stuff into single executable file. haha! :D
- i've write my first c header

## 29/12/2024

- keep on swimming, write more thorough README.md, included `how to use/run the scripts` so other can actually know how use it.
- fixing the  python code for `problem_set_4_1` for the new shell script that produces the shared objects.
