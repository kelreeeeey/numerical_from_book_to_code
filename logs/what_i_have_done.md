# Me Brain Deeds

## 26/12/2024

Add more subdirectories for the sake of better separation

additons:

- bins/
    will be holdin any final program sourced directly from `source/*.c`

- material/
    will be containing any source material, planned to be in markdown formats but pdfs or even pptx would ok too

- python_libs/
    will be containing by the mid representation of shared-object loaded in python class so the `./main.py` could read it.

- shared_objects/
    the compiled shared object for python from `source/*.c`
